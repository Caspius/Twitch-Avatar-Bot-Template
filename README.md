# Twitch Avatar Bot Template

### This is starting point for your customized twitch avatar bot:

1. Download files, change oauth and channel name in config.js.
2. You will need your own avatar sprites with idle, walking and sleeping animations in each direction.

   (Check out Phaser docs to learn how to add your own custom sprites and animations.)
3. All files must be hosted on a web server or localhost.
4. Set up OBS Browser Source component on the scene, with the address to the hosted index.html as a source.

   (You can also capture browser window with the bot running and add a chroma key to setup transparency.)
5. Presto! Bot is running and waiting for the commands and events on your channel!

---

Default command are !help !commands !stop !walk !sleep.

Feel free to add your own commands and avatar stances!
